# WhatsApp Spam Detection API with Flask and Twilio

This project implements a RESTful API using Flask that can be integrated with Twilio to perform real-time spam detection on incoming WhatsApp messages. It uses a machine learning model trained on a spam dataset to classify messages and provide automated responses indicating spam probability. 

## Features

* **Real-time Spam Detection:** Classifies incoming WhatsApp messages as spam or not spam.
* **Twilio Integration:**  Seamlessly integrates with Twilio's WhatsApp API to receive and send messages.
* **Machine Learning:**  Utilizes a OneVsRestClassifier with a linear SVC model for accurate spam classification.
* **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Employs TfidfVectorizer for effective text preprocessing and feature extraction.
* **RESTful API:**  Provides a simple and easy-to-use API endpoint for message classification.

Use code with caution.
Bash

Twilio Account Setup:

Create a Twilio account (or use an existing one): https://www.twilio.com/

Create a WhatsApp Sandbox: https://www.twilio.com/console/whatsapp/learn/sandbox

Note your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio Phone Number.

Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory.

Add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your Twilio credentials:

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token 
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+xxxxxxxxx

Usage

Send a WhatsApp Message: Using a phone number connected to your Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox, send a message to your Twilio Phone Number.

Receive Spam Classification: The API will process the message and send back an automated response indicating whether the message is classified as spam and the confidence level of the prediction.

Accuracy

The machine learning model (OneVsRestClassifier with SVC) achieved an accuracy of over 98% on the test dataset.

Future Improvements

Model Optimization: Experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Dataset Expansion: Use a larger and more diverse dataset to enhance the model's generalization ability.

User Interface: Develop a user-friendly web interface for easier interaction and visualization.
